           <p>Hi! My name is Nick Herrera and I am building this portfolio in order to advance my career in web development and marketing services. After graduating with a degree in Business Administration from Pittsburg State University in 2011, I have been working in the marketing industry and have been gaining knowledge that has helped me bring quality work to my company as well as my clients. As a lifelong learner, I value the importance of coding and web development and think it can become a valuable tool for my career moving forward.</p>


            <p>After this class concludes, I plan on starting my own marketing company with two of my former/current coworkers that will focus on servicing small to medium sized local businesses. This coding bootcamp will give me the tools to be able to keep all programming "in house" and allow our company to run on minimal expenses. With our previous SEO, SEM, and Social Media experience, we hope to be a one stop shop for businesses in the Kansas City area looking to improve their online presence and take their company to the next level</p>


            <p>Overall, I am very excited to get started with this bootcamp and advance my knowledge in coding. I have minimal experience but feel as though I am a quick learner and will put in the work in order to succeed</p>
